    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
         <p>I moved to Buffalo in 2010 from the Finger Lakes area to attend Buffalo State as a 
            communications/ Media Production major, by graduation i had no interest in pursuing a 
            career in that field. for the last 5 years I've been working in the service industy mostly 
            as a bartender. As enjoyable as the job can be working in a fun setting, meeting new people
            and making good money, it has its drawbacks and was getting old and Ive been ready to pivot 
            in a new direction. when Covid put me out of work I knew this was an opportunity to move in 
            a new direction and by a stroke of luck a friend told me about the course and now im finally
            on the path I want to be on.</p>
